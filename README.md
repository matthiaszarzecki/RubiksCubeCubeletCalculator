# RubiksCubeCubeletCalculator

Algorithm that calculates out of how many "outside" cubes a Rubik's Cube consists based on subdivisions on each side, for this code-excercise: https://www.codewars.com/kata/count-the-number-of-cubes-with-paint-on/discuss

Regular (non-Rubik's) Cube: 6 outside cubes
1 subdivision:              8 outside cubes
2 subdivisions:             26 outside cubes
2 subdivisions:             56 outside cubes
4 subdivisions:             98 outside cubes
5 subdivisions:             152 outside cubes
16 subdivisions:            1238 outside cubes
23 subdivisions:            3176 outside cubes
